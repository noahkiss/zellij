# zellij (noahkiss fork)

A personal fork of [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij), based on **v0.44.3**, carrying a
small patch queue aimed at the plugin development loop and a few session-lifecycle papercuts.

**This fork is not accepting issues or pull requests, and none of these patches have been submitted
upstream.** If you found it by accident, you want [the real thing](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij).
Upstream's README, documentation and license apply to everything except the patches below.

## Install

```
brew install noahkiss/tap/zellij-nkmk
```

It installs a binary named `zellij`, so it conflicts with the `zellij` formula. Unlink that first:

```
brew unlink zellij
brew install noahkiss/tap/zellij-nkmk
```

Switching binaries does not migrate running sessions — the old server keeps running under the old
binary until it exits. Restart your sessions to pick up the fork.

## Versioning

`<upstream version>-nkmk.<fork counter>`, e.g. `0.44.3-nkmk.1`. `zellij --version` reports the fork
version, so an install can be verified. The counter resets when the upstream base moves.

Because the version keys `$ZELLIJ_CACHE_DIR/<version>`, the fork does not share plugin artifact or
release-note caches with an upstream build of the same version.

## The patch queue

### Plugin hot-reload (`plugin_watch`, default **on**)

Loaded `file:` plugins have their `.wasm` watched; a change reloads every running instance with the
module cache skipped, so a rebuild swaps the code under the pane without touching the CLI. The
containing directory is watched rather than the file, because build tools replace a `.wasm` by
rename, and paths are canonicalized so a plugin loaded through a symlink is matched against the
file that actually changes.

```kdl
plugin_watch false   // to turn it off
```

This is a config-file setting only. It is read by the server at session start, so there is no CLI
flag for it.

### Declarative plugin permissions

```kdl
plugin_permissions {
    "/home/you/.config/zellij/plugins/my_plugin.wasm" {
        ReadApplicationState
        ChangeApplicationState
        MessageAndLaunchOtherPlugins
    }
}
```

Consulted before the interactive prompt and never written back to `permissions.kdl`, so a later
deny cannot prune it. The key is the plugin location as zellij renders it — for a `file:` plugin
that is the bare path; a `file:`-prefixed key is accepted and normalized.

Only explicitly enumerated local paths work. Wildcards and remote URLs are rejected at parse time:
a pre-grant means trusting whatever wasm ever sits at that path, which is precisely the thing the
hot-reload loop keeps changing, so the set of trusted code has to stay something you wrote down.

This also makes background `load_plugins` plugins grantable at all — they have no pane to show a
prompt in.

Separately, `PermissionCache::cache` now merges rather than replaces. Previously any new permission
request dropped every permission granted before it, and a deny wrote an empty list that wiped the
lot.

### Plugin reload no longer wedges

Three bugs in one path: pending state was created before the checks that can refuse a reload (an
orphaned entry then starved the running instance); a plugin parked on an unanswered permission
prompt counted as "currently loading" and silently parked every later reload for that location for
the rest of the session; and a reload required an exact `(location, configuration)` match, so
`start-or-reload-plugin` without a matching `-c` found nothing and spawned a stray pane instead.

### `dump-screen` works on plugin panes

`zellij action dump-screen --pane-id plugin_N`, with or without `--ansi`, returns the pane's content
instead of an empty string.

### `delete-session` no longer leaves a ghost

The delete waits for the server to stop answering before removing the session_info folder, then
sweeps it briefly. Previously the dying server's final snapshot landed after the delete and the
session reappeared in `zellij ls` with a stale layout.

### `zellij ls -s` marks exited sessions

Dead sessions get an `(EXITED)` suffix. The name is still the first whitespace-separated field, so
`cut`/`awk` parsing is unaffected.

### `attach --no-resurrect`

```
zellij attach my-session -c --no-resurrect
```

Builds the session fresh from the layout instead of from whatever shape it had when it died, so
layout edits apply deterministically. The snapshot is discarded rather than ignored — leaving it
would keep the name taken by a dead session.

## Not done

- **`--plugin-watch` as a CLI flag.** `Options` crosses the client/server protobuf contract, and
  carrying a new field over it means regenerating the checked-in generated Rust. The setting is
  config-file only rather than pay that cost.
- **Unwatching a plugin's `.wasm` when it unloads.** Watches accumulate for the life of the
  session; a change to a no-longer-loaded plugin resolves to no running instances and does nothing.

## Working on this fork

`upstream` points at `zellij-org/zellij`. Each patch is its own commit on top of the `v0.44.3` tag,
so moving to a newer upstream tag is a rebase onto that tag. The two config-surface patches (the
watcher and the permission grants) share plumbing and land as one commit.

```
cargo build --release
cargo test -p zellij-utils -p zellij-server
```

The toolchain is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`; rustup installs it on the first cargo invocation.
Debug builds expect the WASM plugins to be built from source — use `--release`, which uses the
prebuilt assets checked into `zellij-utils/assets/plugins/`.
